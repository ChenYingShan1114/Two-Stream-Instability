# Two-Stream-Instability
I use particle-in-cell simulation method to simulate the two stream instability which is a common instability in plasma physics. It can be induced by an energetic particle stream injected in a plasma, or setting a current along the plasma so different species (ions and electrons) can have different drift velocities. The energy from the particles can lead to plasma wave excitation. (WIKIPEDIA)
